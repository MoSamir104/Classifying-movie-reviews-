# Movie Review Classification from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to build and train a text classification model from scratch to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The model is built using a deep learning approach, focusing on preprocessing, tokenization, embedding, and the use of neural network architectures.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, padding, and text normalization.
- **Custom Word Embeddings**: Implement custom word embeddings to represent words as dense vectors.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: build a ANN architecture.
- **Binary Classification**: The model is trained to classify reviews as either positive or negative.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model using accuracy, because the classes are balanced.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

### Dataset

The project uses a dataset of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
### Usage

1. **Preprocess the Data**: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, tokenizing, and padding the reviews.
   
2. **Train the Model**: Train the model on the prepared dataset using the provided scripts.
   
3. **Evaluate the Model**: Use the test set to evaluate the performance of the model.

```python
python train_model.py
```

### Results

After training, the model achieves an accuracy of `XX%` on the test set. The project also provides visualizations of training loss and accuracy over epochs.
